## ü™ü Sliding window
>The sliding window is a very intriguing technique used to solve some of the complex problems involving an array or a string. It is often used to reduce the time complexity of the >problem from O(n¬≤) to O(n).
>
>The basic idea is to maintain a window that satisfies the problem constraints. A window can be represented by taking two pointers ‚Äî say left and right ‚Äî that points to a specific >index in the array or specific character in case of a string.
>
>The window is called ‚Äúunstable‚Äù if it breaks any of the problem conditions. The window then tries to stabilize itself by shrinking (increment left pointer) or expanding (increment >right pointer). The process continues until the problem is solved.
