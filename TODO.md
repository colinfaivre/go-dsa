# TODO

## 💪 Practice
- ➡️ implement `Dijkstra` naive
- implement `LinkedList`
- implement `Queue` with a `LinkedList`
- implement `Stack` with a `LinkedList`
- finish `Heap` course
- implement `Heap`
- finish `Dijkstra` course notes
- implement `Dijkstra` using `Heap`

## 🏗️ Maintain
- fix flaky tests (map keys ordering is not reliable in graph traversals)
- better understand `ginkgo` test architectures and commands
- better organise test mocks
- some sorting algos return the sorted array and others sort the original in place
- time track function executions: https://coderwall.com/p/cp5fya/measuring-execution-time-in-go
- use what could be useful in `ts` dsa repo here and delete it

## 📔 Document
- extract course specific implementation of algo into `problems` directory
    - karger min cut problem
    - count inversions
    - shortest paths with BFS
    - quicksort with pivot selection or randomization
- document applications of data structures and algo
- find a way to include `stanford dsa course` notes in this repo (`docs` or specific `READMEs`)

## 🧗‍♂️Train
- add tests in `/problems` for sorting problems
- add copy_me template for scaffolding an algo from scratch to train
    - space complexity
    - time complexity
    - applications
    - implementations
