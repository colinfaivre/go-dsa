# TODO

## 💪 Practice
- ➡️ `Dijkstra` naive, add weird test cases for small graph:
    - circular
    - long shortcut to go to 4 with multiple ones
    - long shorcut from 1 to 4 with weight less than 6
    - orphan nodes
    - test case from week2 discussion by course instructor
- implement `LinkedList`
- implement `Queue` with a `LinkedList`
- implement `Stack` with a `LinkedList`
- finish `Heap` course
- implement `HeapSort`
- finish `Dijkstra` course notes
- implement `Dijkstra` using `Heap`

## 🏗️ Maintain
- better organise test mocks
- some sorting algos return the sorted array and others sort the original in place
- time track function executions: https://coderwall.com/p/cp5fya/measuring-execution-time-in-go
- use what could be useful in `ts` dsa repo here and delete it
- use BeforeEach() testing pattern
- continue exploring ginkgo

## 📔 Document
- add Dikstra interview/documentary
- extract course specific implementation of algo into `problems` directory
    - count inversions
    - shortest paths with BFS
    - quicksort with pivot selection or randomization
- document applications of data structures and algo
- find a way to include `stanford dsa course` notes in this repo (`docs` or specific `READMEs`)

## 🧗‍♂️Train
- add tests in `/problems` for sorting problems
- add copy_me template for scaffolding an algo from scratch to train
    - space complexity
    - time complexity
    - applications
    - implementations
