# TODO

## 🏗️ Build
- ➡️ solve `Dijkstra` using `Heap`
- find an easy `go` implementation for `Hashmap`
- add an implementation of `BinarySearchTree`
- compare stack and queue slice based implementation with the LinkedList implementation (https://coderwall.com/p/cp5fya/measuring-execution-time-in-go)
- extract course specific implementation of algo into `problems` directory
    - count inversions
    - shortest paths with BFS
    - quicksort with pivot selection or randomization
    - karger min cut
    - SCCs on directed graph
    - SCCs on undirected graph
- use what could be useful in `ts` dsa repo here and delete it

## 🧪 Test
- continue exploring `ginkgo`
- mocks
- BeforeEach()
- run just one file tests (one test suite per file ?)

## 📔 Document
- use https://go.dev/doc/comment on every file with:
  - applications of data structures and algo
  - `stanford dsa course` notes

## 🧗 Train
- ➡️ update problems/README.md
- ➡️ add two_sum sliding window solution
- add tests in `/problems` for sorting problems
- add copy_me template for scaffolding an algo from scratch to train
    - space complexity
    - time complexity
    - applications
    - implementations
