# TODO

## 💪 Practice
- ➡️ solve `Dijkstra` using `Heap`
- implement `LinkedList`
- 🤔 implement `Queue` with a `LinkedList`
- 🤔 implement `Stack` with a `LinkedList`

## 🏗️ Maintain
- some sorting algos return the sorted array and others sort the original in place
- time track function executions: https://coderwall.com/p/cp5fya/measuring-execution-time-in-go
- use what could be useful in `ts` dsa repo here and delete it
- use BeforeEach() testing pattern
- continue exploring ginkgo: test mocks

## 📔 Document
- use https://go.dev/doc/comment
- extract course specific implementation of algo into `problems` directory
    - count inversions
    - shortest paths with BFS
    - quicksort with pivot selection or randomization
- document applications of data structures and algo
- include `stanford dsa course` notes in this repo

## 🧗 Train
- add tests in `/problems` for sorting problems
- add copy_me template for scaffolding an algo from scratch to train
    - space complexity
    - time complexity
    - applications
    - implementations
