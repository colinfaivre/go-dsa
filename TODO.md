# TODO

## 💪 Practice
- implement `Dijkstra` naive
- finish `Heap` course
- implement `Heap`
- finish `Dijkstra` course notes
- implement `Dijkstra` using heap

## 🏗️ Maintain
- fix flaky tests (map keys ordering is not reliable)
- better organise test mocks
- use testing framework everywhere
- time track function executions: https://coderwall.com/p/cp5fya/measuring-execution-time-in-go
- rename `ds` folder and package into `datastructures`
- rename `sort` folder and package into `algorithms`
- rename `utils` folder and package into `parsing`
- add a `problems` folder and package

## 📔 Document
- extract course specific implementation of algo
- document applications of data structures and algo
- write a hierarchical `README` with links to algo and ds implementations
- find a way to include stanford dsa course notes in this repo (`docs` or specific `READMEs`)

## 🧗‍♂️Train
- add a folder to recreate dsas or problem solutions against testing data
