# TODO

## 🏗️ Build
- ➡️ solve `clustering` problem part 2 : check dupplicates or try on a very small test set
- ➡️ add an implementation of the `Trie` datastructure
- `quicksort` with pivot selection or randomization

## 🧪 Test
- ➡️ improve error handling in `Heap` (methods should sometimes return errors)
- improve `BFS` and `DFS` tests with concrete problems to solve ?
- improve and test error handling everywhere
- compare `stack`, `queue` and `slice` based implementations with the LinkedList implementation (https://coderwall.com/p/cp5fya/measuring-execution-time-in-go)
- continue exploring `ginkgo`: mocks
- run just one file tests (one test suite per file ?)

## 📔 Document
- use https://go.dev/doc/comment on every file with:
  - applications of data structures and algo

## 🧗 Train
- ➡️ add` two_sum` sliding window solution
- ➡️ update problems/README.md
- add tests in `/problems` for sorting problems
- add copy_me template for scaffolding an algo from scratch to train
    - space complexity
    - time complexity
    - applications
    - implementations
- count inversions
- shortest paths with BFS
- `SCCs` on directed graph
- `SCCs` on undirected graph
